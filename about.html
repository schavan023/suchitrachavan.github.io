        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Dr. Suchitra Chavan, a bioinformatician with a strong blend of laboratory and computational expertise. After transitioning from bench science to computational biology, I specialized in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis and scalable bioinformatics workflows. I hold a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia, an M.S. in Biochemistry, a B.S. in Chemistry, and a Professional Data Science Certification from HarvardX. </p>
        <p> In my current role as a Bioinformatician with the CDC's Scientific Computing and Bioinformatics Team,I lead the design and implementation of scalable Nextflow pipelines for infectious disease surveillance, focusing on pathogens like Legionella and SARS-CoV-2. My responsibilities include RNA-Seq analysis, high-throughput NGS data processing, and workflow automation in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. With expertise in programming language such as R, Python, and Bash, I effectively bridge experimental biology and computational science to provide reproducible, impactful analytics that support public health decision-making. </p>
        <p>I am also passionate about teaching and mentorship, having served as a lecturer and visiting assistant professor at various institutions. I empower students to pursue careers in medicine and bioinformatics and promote a deeper understanding of the intersection between biology and data science. As a strong advocate for diversity in STEM, I engage in community outreach, organizing workshops, and initiatives that inspire and support women in science. I leverage my own experience to help students navigate challenges in the STEM education system and achieve their professional goals.</p>
