            <h2>Key Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Toxic Silicosis Study</strong>: In this project, I took the lead on the RNA-Seq transcriptomics analysis to improve data quality for public health guidelines on crystalline silica exposure in smokers. Using bioinformatics tools such as limma-voom, I identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and assessed their biological significance. I further enhanced the analysis by generating informative visualizations in R, which helped in the interpretation of results. Additionally, I employed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and KEGG pathway analysis to uncover relevant biological pathways involved in the toxic effects of silica exposure. The successful completion of this project has resulted in a manuscript under submission, contributing to the development of evidence-driven insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying silicosis and refining public health guidelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Legionella Nextflow Workflow Development</strong>: Designed and optimized Nextflow pipeline, reducing data processing time by 35%, improving Legionella genomic analysis for epidemiological surveillance.</li>
                <li><strong>Sourmash Nextflow Workflow</strong>: Increased genomic signature processing throughput by 40%, enabling scalable analysis for public health initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Crankshaft Contribution</strong>: Contributed to the Crankshaft project, a Rust-based headless workflow engine designed for scalable bioinformatics analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Aquascope & C-WAP Pipeline Development</strong>: Optimized pathogen surveillance pipeline, enabling efficient processing of short-read and long-read sequencing data for SARS-CoV-2 genomic analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>AI/ML for Cervical Cancer</strong>: Applied machine learning (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) to develop predictive models, improving early detection of cervical cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Single-Cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) Analysis Using Seurat</strong>: Conducted in-depth analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, applying Seurat for quality control (QC), normalization, clustering, and differential expression analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Multi-Modal Data</strong>: Combined single-cell transcriptomics data (scRNA-Seq) with other modalities like scATAC-Seq, using Seurat and other R packages for integrative analysis, enhancing the understanding of cellular regulation and gene expression dynamics.</li>
